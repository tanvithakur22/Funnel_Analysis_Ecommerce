🌟 E-commerce Conversion Funnel Analysis (Synthetic Data)
Project Overview
This project applies data science techniques to a simulated e-commerce environment to maximize user conversion and revenue. Using a 40,000+ event synthetic dataset (engineered with Faker), I modeled the complete Browse → Purchase funnel, identified critical user drop-off points, and delivered actionable, segment-specific optimization insights.

Core Achievements
Data Generation: Engineered a large-scale synthetic dataset (10K+ users) to model real-world user behavior and funnel flow.

Funnel Optimization: Calculated granular conversion and drop-off rates, highlighting the highest-friction stage (e.g., Checkout drop-off) for immediate product focus.

Segment Analysis: Performed multi-dimensional analysis (by Channel, Device, and Product Category) to determine the most valuable acquisition paths and segments.

Statistical Validation: Applied Z-tests to validate conversion rate differences between segments (e.g., Mobile vs. Desktop).

Deliverables: Visualized key insights (funnel plots, segmented charts) to translate complex metrics into clear recommendations for product teams.
